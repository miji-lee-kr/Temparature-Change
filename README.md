## Project: Explore Weather Trends

## Instructions
The goal is to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live (Melbourne).

## Steps
1. Extract the data from the database using SQL.
2. Create a line chart
3. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your cityâ€™s averages, as well as overall trends.
## Submission
The final analysis will contain a plot of the data, analysis of said plot and outlines the steps taken:

- An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
- What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)
- How did you calculate the moving average?
- What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
- Line chart with local and global temperature trends
- At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
